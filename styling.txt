Follow these instructions using the Catppuccin Mocha color palette, JetBrains Mono Nerd Font, and Font Awesome icons:

Overall Aesthetic & Layout
Dark Base Background:

Set the body or a primary container to a deep, dark color: #11111b (Crust) or #181825 (Mantle). This will emulate the desktop wallpaper.
Consider a subtle, dark background image that complements the "cosmic" or abstract feel, but keep it low-contrast to avoid distraction.
Modular, Layered Structure:

Use div elements to create distinct "windows" or "panels" for your portfolio content.
Apply background-color: #313244 (Surface0), #45475a (Surface1), or #585b70 (Surface2) to these panels to give them a slightly lighter but still dark appearance, akin to the terminal windows floating over the desktop.
Use border-radius to give panels slightly rounded corners for a softer, modern look.
Implement subtle box-shadow with a dark color or no shadow to maintain the flat, minimalist feel.
Asymmetrical Balance:

Design your main portfolio content (e.g., project list, "about me" section) to dominate the central area, similar to the Neovim window.
Introduce a smaller, fixed "system info" or "status" panel in a corner (e.g., top-left, bottom-right) for personal branding, quick links, or current status.
Typography & Icons
Primary Font: JetBrains Mono Nerd Font:

Import and set font-family: 'JetBrains Mono Nerd Font', monospace; for all text within your terminal-like sections and potentially for your entire site. This is crucial for the authentic terminal feel and for rendering custom icons.
Ensure proper fallback fonts (monospace) are included.
Font Awesome Icons:

Integrate the Font Awesome library into your project.
Use Font Awesome icons (<i> tags with classes) to:
Prefix menu items (e.g., <i class="fas fa-file"></i> New Project).
Indicate links (e.g., <i class="fab fa-github"></i> GitHub).
Represent skills or technologies (e.g., <i class="fab fa-react"></i> React).
Provide visual cues in status bars (e.g., <i class="fas fa-plug"></i> 42 skills loaded).
Color icons using the accent colors from the Catppuccin Mocha palette.
Color Palette Application (Catppuccin Mocha)
Backgrounds:

Page Background (body): #11111b (Crust) or #181825 (Mantle).
Panel Backgrounds (div for windows/cards): #313244 (Surface0), #45475a (Surface1), or #585b70 (Surface2).
Text Colors:

Primary Text: #cdd6f4 (Text) for general content within panels.
Secondary Text/Subheadings: #bac2de (Subtext1) or #a6adc8 (Subtext0) for descriptions, smaller details, or less prominent information.
Accent Colors (Interactive & Highlighted Elements):

Links/Buttons: #89b4fa (Blue), #cba6f7 (Mauve), or #a6e3a1 (Green).
Hover/Active States: A slightly brighter or different accent color on hover, e.g., if a link is Blue, make its hover Lavender (#b4befe).
Code Snippets/Highlights: #fab387 (Peach) or #f9e2af (Yellow) for inline code or specific syntax highlighting.
Success Messages: #a6e3a1 (Green).
Error/Warning Messages: #f38ba8 (Red) or #fab387 (Peach).
Neovim-like Logo/Header: A prominent accent like #cba6f7 (Mauve) or #89b4fa (Blue) for your portfolio's main title or a simulated application logo.
Borders & Dividers:

Use subtle border colors, often Overlay0 (#6c7086) or Overlay1 (#7f849c), or even just a 1px shift in background color to delineate sections within panels.
Interactive Elements & Details
Buttons & Input Fields:

Style with Surface0 or Surface1 backgrounds and Text or Subtext1 color for input.
Use accent colors for button text or borders on hover/focus.
Keep borders minimal, relying on box-shadow or background changes for focus states.
Scrollbars:

Customize scrollbars (if desired and supported by browser) to match the dark theme, using Overlay0 or Overlay1 for the thumb and Mantle or Crust for the track.
Terminal Prompt Simulation:

Create a dedicated div for a simulated terminal prompt.
Use JetBrains Mono Nerd Font.
Prefix lines with a custom prompt string (e.g., user@portfolio:~ $) in Text color, with the ~ $ perhaps in an accent color like Green.
Animate a typing cursor or simply display static command lines.
Status Bars:

Implement small "status bars" at the bottom of panels to display concise information (e.g., "Last updated: 2024-01-01", "3 projects loaded").
Use Subtext0 or Overlay0 for text and Mantle or Crust for background.
By systematically applying these guidelines, you can create a portfolio site that captures the sophisticated, highly personalized, and functional aesthetic of the described terminal UI.
